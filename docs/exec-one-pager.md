# Neurop Forge
## Controlled AI Execution for Enterprise

---

### The Risk

AI systems that generate or modify code create enterprise risk:

- **Unpredictable behavior** — outputs vary run to run
- **Audit failures** — no traceable execution path
- **Rollback complexity** — changes are difficult to reverse
- **Compliance gaps** — no proof of what AI actually did

Organizations deploying AI agents face a choice: accept the risk or limit AI capability.

---

### The Solution

Neurop Forge provides a third option: **controlled execution**.

AI agents operate within a verified, immutable function library. They can search, compose, and execute — but they cannot write code or modify logic.

**Result:** AI becomes a controlled operator, not an unpredictable author.

---

### How It Works

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| AI searches blocks by intent | Allowed |
| AI composes verified blocks | Allowed |
| AI executes with full trace | Allowed |
| AI writes new code | Blocked |
| AI modifies existing logic | Blocked |
| AI bypasses verification | Blocked |

Every execution is:
- **Verified** — blocks pass validation before admission
- **Immutable** — hash-locked, cannot be altered
- **Traced** — full audit trail on every run
- **Tiered** — safety classification (deterministic vs context-dependent)

---

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Verified blocks | 2,740 |
| Source modules | 175 |
| Categories | 30+ |
| Tier-A (deterministic) | 2,060 |
| Tier-B (context-dependent) | 680 |

---

### Trust Tiers

**Tier-A: Unrestricted**
- Deterministic, pure functions
- No side effects, no external dependencies
- Safe for unrestricted AI use

**Tier-B: Controlled**
- Context-dependent operations
- Requires explicit permission
- AI cannot silently invoke

---

### Use Cases

- **AI-powered automation** with auditable execution
- **Regulated industries** requiring compliance trails
- **Platform teams** deploying AI agents at scale
- **Enterprise AI** where predictability matters

---

### Not For

- Projects requiring AI to generate arbitrary code
- Research on unconstrained AI capabilities
- Applications where auditability is not required

---

### Summary

Neurop Forge turns AI agents from unpredictable authors into controlled operators.

2,700+ verified blocks. Full execution trace. Zero code modification.

Neurop Forge does not generate code, modify logic, or allow AI to change execution behavior.
