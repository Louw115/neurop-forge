Neurop Forge — AI-Native Execution Control Layer
License

2,700+ verified operations that AI can search, compose, and execute — but never modify.

CATEGORY: AI Execution Control Layer

For Executives
Your AI agents are already making decisions. Neurop Forge makes those decisions controlled, traceable, and compliant.

AI executes pre-approved operations only — it cannot write code, delete data, or bypass your policies.
Every operation is cryptographically logged in a tamper-proof audit chain.
Policy enforcement blocks unauthorized actions before they happen.
Designed for regulated environments.
Ready for SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS compliance reviews.
For Engineers
2,700+ production-grade function blocks with hash-locked immutability.

Trust tier classification:

Tier-A: safe for unrestricted AI use

Tier-B: requires explicit permission

Semantic search and composition — AI finds blocks by intent and chains them into workflows.

Full execution traces with inputs, outputs, and timestamps.

Whitelist / blacklist policy engine.

Drop-in Python library.

What Neurop Forge Is
Neurop Forge transforms AI agents from unpredictable code writers into controlled operators.

AI does not generate code.
AI does not modify logic.
AI does not bypass trust rules.
Instead, AI:

Searches a verified library by intent
Composes block workflows
Executes deterministically with full traceability
The result:
Auditable AI. Reversible decisions. Insurable operations.

One-Line Definition
Neurop Forge is an AI Execution Control Layer that allows AI agents to build and operate software by executing pre-verified, policy-governed blocks — without generating or modifying code.

The Problem
AI systems that generate or modify code are:

Unpredictable
Impossible to audit
Difficult to roll back
Risky in production
The Solution
Neurop Forge enforces immutability at the architecture level:

What AI Can Do	What AI Cannot Do
Search blocks by intent	Write new code
Compose block graphs	Modify existing blocks
Execute with full trace	Bypass verification
Reason over metadata	Skip trust tiers
Every block is:

Verified — passes automated validation before admission
Immutable — hash-locked, cannot be altered
Traced — full execution lineage on every run
Scored — trust tier classification (A or B)
Trust Tiers
Blocks are classified into safety tiers for controlled AI composition:

Tier	Count	What It Means
A	2,060	Deterministic, pure functions, no side effects, no external dependencies
B	680	Context-dependent, may require specific inputs, explicit opt-in required
Tier-A blocks are safe for unrestricted AI use.
Tier-B blocks require explicit permission — AI cannot silently use them.

Quick Example
AI executes blocks. AI does not write code.

from neurop_forge import NeuropForge

forge = NeuropForge()

# AI executes a verified block
result = forge.execute_block("reverse_string", {"s": "hello"})
print(result)  # {'result': 'olleh', 'success': True}

# AI composes a workflow from verified blocks
workflow = forge.run_workflow("text_normalization", {"text": "Hello World"})

# AI queries the library
blocks = forge.list_verified_blocks(category="string", tier="A", limit=10)
The AI used three blocks. It modified zero lines of code.

Installation
From PyPI:

pip install neurop-forge
From Source (GitHub):

git clone https://github.com/Louw115/neurop-forge.git
cd neurop-forge
python -m pip install -e .
Neurop Forge is designed to sit under AI agents, not replace them.
