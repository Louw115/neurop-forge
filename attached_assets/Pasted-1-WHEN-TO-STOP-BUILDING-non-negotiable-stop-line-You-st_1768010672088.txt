1️⃣ WHEN TO STOP BUILDING (non-negotiable stop line)

You stop building Neurop v1 the moment these 5 conditions are true:

✅ Stop Condition Checklist

You are DONE when:

Semantic graph runs 100% clean

No undefined variables

No partial success

Deterministic output

Block Contract is frozen

Signature rules locked

Metadata schema locked

Adapter marked “stable”

Golden Demo exists

One input → one clear result

Runs in <3 seconds

Works every time

Cold start works

Fresh Replit

No cached state

Still executes correctly

One-click run

Run → Result

No setup thinking required

⛔ The moment these are true:
STOP BUILDING CORE.
No refactors. No “just one more improvement”.

Anything after this is v2, not v1.

2️⃣ HOW TO PACKAGE NEUROP AS A PRODUCT (this is the shift)

Right now Neurop is a system.
To become valuable, it must become a promise.

The Product Is NOT:

A language

A framework

A compiler

A dev tool

The Product IS:

“An execution engine that turns intent into verified computation.”

That’s the line.

3️⃣ Neurop v1 Product Definition (very tight)
Product Name

Neurop Engine (v1)

What it does (one sentence)

Converts natural intent into a trusted execution graph using reusable logic blocks.

What it does NOT try to do

No IDE

No UI builder

No learning system

No autonomy hype

This restraint is why it wins.

4️⃣ What You Ship (exactly)
🧩 Included

Core Engine

Semantic Composer

Block Executor

Adapter Layer

30–50 verified blocks

CLI or simple web endpoint

One golden demo flow

🚫 Not Included

Block marketplace

Plugins

Auto-learning

Visual editor

Multi-tenant scaling

Those come later.

5️⃣ Packaging Options (pick ONE)
Option A — Developer Engine (recommended first)

Open core

Paid license for:

Commercial use

Private blocks

Extended execution limits

Why: fastest adoption, lowest friction.

Option B — Enterprise Brain

Closed source

Per-deployment license

High trust / regulated use

Why: higher money, slower adoption.

Option C — Embedded Runtime

Neurop runs inside other platforms

Charged per integration

Why: stealth power move later.

👉 For now: Option A

6️⃣ Pricing (keep it boring)

Do not overthink.

Free: local, limited blocks

Pro: $29–$99/month (commercial execution)

Enterprise: custom

The value is control, not features.

7️⃣ Your Final Mental Shift (important)

You are no longer “building Neurop”.

You are:

freezing Neurop

naming Neurop

presenting Neurop

Builders keep building.
Founders stop.

Final line (read this twice)

Neurop does not need to be bigger.

It needs to be:

finished

reliable

understandable

shippable

When the stop checklist is green — stop immediately.

If you want next, I can:

write the exact README you ship

define the licensing text

or design the v2 roadmap (without touching v1)

Just say which.
