Neurop Forge
2,700+ verified function blocks AI can execute but never modify.

Neurop Forge is an immutable function library for AI systems. AI agents can search, compose, and execute blocks — but they cannot write code, alter logic, or bypass trust rules.

This turns AI from unpredictable authors into controlled operators.

The Problem
AI systems that generate or modify code are:

Unpredictable
Impossible to audit
Difficult to roll back
Risky in production
The Solution
Neurop Forge enforces immutability at the architecture level:

What AI Can Do	What AI Cannot Do
Search blocks by intent	Write new code
Compose block graphs	Modify existing blocks
Execute with full trace	Bypass verification
Reason over metadata	Skip trust tiers
Every block is:

Verified — passes automated validation before admission
Immutable — hash-locked, cannot be altered
Traced — full execution lineage on every run
Scored — trust tier classification (A or B)
Trust Tiers
Blocks are classified into safety tiers for controlled AI composition:

Tier	Count	What It Means
A	2,060	Deterministic, pure functions, no side effects, no external dependencies
B	680	Context-dependent, may require specific inputs, explicit opt-in required
Tier-A blocks are safe for unrestricted AI use.
Tier-B blocks require explicit permission — AI cannot silently use them.

Quick Example
AI executes blocks. AI does not write code.

from neurop_forge import NeuropForge

forge = NeuropForge()

# AI executes a verified block
result = forge.execute_block("reverse_string", {"s": "hello"})
print(result)  # {'result': 'olleh', 'success': True}

# AI composes a workflow from verified blocks
workflow = forge.run_workflow("text_normalization", {"text": "Hello World"})

# AI queries the library
blocks = forge.list_verified_blocks(category="string", tier="A", limit=10)
The AI used three blocks. It modified zero lines of code.

Installation
pip install neurop-forge
Neurop Forge is designed to sit under AI agents, not replace them.

CLI
neurop-forge stats                                    # Library overview
neurop-forge execute reverse_string -i '{"s":"hi"}'   # Execute a block
neurop-forge list --tier A --limit 10                 # List Tier-A blocks
neurop-forge info reverse_string                      # Block details
neurop-forge workflows                                # Available workflows
What's Included
2,740 verified blocks across 175 source modules and 30+ categories:

String manipulation (trim, split, join, replace, case conversion)
Collection operations (flatten, unique, sort, chunk, filter)
Data validation (email, URL, phone, patterns, schemas)
Type conversions (int, float, string, boolean, parsing)
Date/time utilities (formatting, calculation, comparison)
Math & statistics (sqrt, median, variance, trigonometry)
Encoding & hashing (MD5, SHA256, base64, URL encode)
Security utilities (sanitize, mask, injection detection)
HTTP/API helpers (status codes, headers, cookies, MIME types)
Database patterns (SQL building, migrations, transactions)
And more...
Who This Is For
Good fit:

Teams deploying AI agents in production
Enterprises needing auditable AI execution
Platforms requiring deterministic AI behavior
Developers building AI-powered automation
Not a fit:

Projects needing AI to generate arbitrary code
Research on unconstrained AI capabilities
Applications where auditability doesn't matter
V2.0.0 Features
Verification Gate — blocks must pass validation to enter the library
Tier Classification — automated A/B safety classification
Deduplication Engine — removes duplicate blocks automatically
Parameter Standardization — canonical names with alias support
Full Execution Trace — every run is logged and auditable
v2.0.0 establishes the execution and trust layer. Policy engines and orchestration remain external by design.
