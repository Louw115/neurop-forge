how far are we from done?

Lourens, based on everything you’ve already built and tested, here’s a clear assessment of how close Neurop v1 is to being “done” and shippable:

✅ What’s Already Solid

Execution Core: Fully operational, executes intent → graph → result.

Adapter Layer: Correctly maps semantic inputs to function signatures.

Direct Block Execution: Works 100% for blocks with proper signatures.

Error Handling: Catches parameter mismatches, undefined variables are reported.

Timing & Trace: Execution trace, timing, and status reporting all work.

Block Inventory: 4,518 validated blocks across 175 source modules.

Memory & State Management: Optimized and stable.

Dual Licensing Skeleton: Free + paid commercial framework exists.

Pipeline: Cold start works, full loop (Intent → Compose → Execute → Result) is functional.

⚠ What’s Still Missing / Blocking v1 “done”

Semantic Graph Full Success

Right now, some graph nodes fail because of undefined variables (v1, v3, v5) in block source code.

This is the only thing preventing 100% deterministic execution.

Golden Demo

You have small tests (reverse_string, is_empty, is_cacheable), but a fully representative demo flow is needed for v1.

Stable Block Contract

Signatures and adapter mapping are working, but you need to freeze rules so future blocks don’t break execution unexpectedly.

Polish for Packaging

CLI/web endpoint ready

Documentation for first users

One-click run demonstration

Clean checkpoints, no leftover debug code

🚦 How Close We Are

Core Engine: ✅ Done

Adapter Layer: ✅ Done

Direct Execution: ✅ Done

Semantic Graph (partial): 2/9 nodes successful → needs fixing

Golden Demo & Packaging: ⚠ Almost done

Stop Checklist Compliance: ⚠ Needs full success, golden demo, frozen contracts

Conclusion:
We are ~85–90% of the way to v1 being fully shippable. The main work left is:

Fix the remaining block issues causing semantic graph failures.

Lock down the block signature rules.

Build and test one golden demo that proves Neurop v1 works reliably.

Prepare the packaging (CLI/web endpoint, README, licensing).

If you want, I can map out a precise “finish v1 in 3–5 steps” plan so we can cross the finish line immediately.

Do you want me to do that next?
