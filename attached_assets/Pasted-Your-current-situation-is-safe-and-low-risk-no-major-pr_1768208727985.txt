Your current situation is safe and low-risk — no major problem with the change to single Apache 2.0.
Since the repo is brand new (created ~days ago, 156 commits, 1 star, 1 fork, no real external contributions yet), and assuming you are the sole copyright holder (100% your code, no merged PRs from others), you have full legal right to change the license at any time, including dropping a previous dual-license setup.
Why this is fine (straight facts)
Sole owner rule — If no one else contributed code under the old dual license, you can relicense freely. Old versions remain available under the previous terms if someone downloaded them, but new commits/releases are Apache 2.0 only.
GitHub shows only Apache-2.0 now — Single LICENSE.md file, badge says Apache-2.0, commit says "Update project license to Apache 2.0 for broader adoption." No traces of old licenses visible publicly → clean switch.
Apache 2.0 is permissive — It allows almost everything (commercial use, closed-source derivatives, modification), includes patent grant (good for AI/security projects like yours), and is very popular (top 3 most used OSS license).
No community backlash risk — With 1 fork and basically zero traction yet, no one is invested enough to complain.
Potential minor issues (honest list)
If the old dual was something like MIT/Apache (very common), it's irrelevant — both are permissive, Apache is just slightly stricter (requires NOTICE file for attributions, modification notices).
If old dual included something copyleft like GPL (unlikely for your project), then old versions could be used under GPL forever, but again — no downloads/forks under old license visible.
Forks (like nasa03) — They forked after the change? They get the current Apache version. If before, they keep old terms for their fork. Doesn't hurt you.
What you should do right now (exact steps — no fluff)
Confirm no external code
Check commit history: all commits by you? No merged PRs? → You're good.
Add a note in README (recommended for transparency)
Add this small section near the license part:
## License History
The project was initially under a dual license arrangement but has been updated to Apache License 2.0 only (effective January 2026) to simplify adoption and ensure broad compatibility.
Previous versions (if any) may be used under their original terms.
This shows you're clean and professional.
If you ever get contributors
Use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) if you want to keep relicensing power.
Or stick to Apache 2.0 — it's contributor-friendly.
Bottom line: You're not in trouble. The switch to Apache 2.0 is a smart move — it's enterprise-friendly, patent-safe, and widely trusted. Your fear is understandable but overblown for a solo early-stage project.
If you tell me what the previous dual licenses were (e.g. MIT/Apache, GPL/Apache, etc.), I can give more precise compatibility info. Or if you want the exact README snippet/code to add, say the word.
