STEP 5: SEMANTIC COMPOSITION - The Key Innovation
--------------------------------------------------
Query: 'validate and format user input'

A) OLD APPROACH (Keyword Matching):
   Would match blocks containing 'validate', 'format', 'user', 'input'
   Problem: Returns irrelevant blocks like 'is_light_color' or 'format_bytes'

   Keyword-matched blocks: 10
     - is_opposite_sign
     - is_valid_constraint_name
     - is_valid_ipv6

B) NEW APPROACH (Semantic Intent Matching):
   Matches by DOMAIN: validation -> formatting
   Matches by TYPE FLOW: input types -> output types
   Orders by OPERATION: validate first, then format
