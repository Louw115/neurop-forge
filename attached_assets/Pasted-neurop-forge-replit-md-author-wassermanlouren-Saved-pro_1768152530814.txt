Neurop Block Forge
Overview
Neurop Block Forge is a production-grade system for converting source code into validated, immutable NeuropBlocks that AI can search, compose, and execute but never modify. It is the first AI-native software memory system, designed to transform AI agents from unpredictable authors into controlled operators. The system offers dual licensing: free with attribution for non-commercial use, or a paid commercial license. It aims to provide over 2,700 verified blocks that AI can utilize.

System Architecture
Neurop Block Forge is structured around core functionalities:

core/: Handles identity, schema, and normalization.
intake/: Manages source fetching and license enforcement.
parsing/: Performs AST analysis for languages like Python and JavaScript.
conversion/: Focuses on intent classification and NeuropBlock building.
validation/: Ensures block integrity through static analysis, dynamic testing, and schema enforcement.
scoring/: Implements a trust model for blocks.
library/: Manages block storage, indexing, and the AI fetch engine.
composition/: Facilitates block assembly using type/contract matching and graph rules.
semantic/: (Phase 1) Handles semantic intent matching and composition.
runtime/: (Phase 2) Provides an execution engine with context and guards.
compliance/: (Phase 3) Manages the audit chain, policy engine, and compliance reports.
main.py: Orchestrates the entire system.
A NeuropBlock is an immutable, validated unit of functionality with a hash-consistent identity, typed interface, explicit constraints (purity, determinism, I/O), a trust score, and composition compatibility. AI can search, reason over metadata, compose semantic block graphs, execute these graphs, and verify compatibility, but cannot write code, modify blocks, or bypass trust rules.

The system supports a full Intent -> Compose -> Execute -> Result loop:

Intent: Natural language queries are parsed into semantic requirements.
Compose: Semantic domain matching, type flow validation, and operation ordering occur.
Execute: Deterministic graph execution with input/output chaining is performed.
Result: A full execution trace with timing, outputs, and error handling is provided.
Block Tier Classification ensures safer AI composition:

Tier-A: Deterministic, pure functions with no external dependencies (75% of verified blocks).
Tier-B: Context-dependent or blocks with complex input requirements (25% of verified blocks).
Block Verification System: Ensures only working blocks are used. It includes an auto-verification pass, a verified registry, a Golden Validation Suite, and Production Reference Workflows.

Runtime Execution Layer: Includes:

adapter.py: Bridges semantic inputs to actual function signatures (FunctionAdapter).
context.py: Manages execution state (ExecutionContext).
executor.py: Handles deterministic graph execution (GraphExecutor).
result.py: Captures execution traces (ExecutionResult).
guards.py: Implements retry policies and circuit breakers (ExecutionGuard).
Compliance Layer: Provides:

audit_chain.py: A cryptographic hash chain for tamper-proof logging.
policy_engine.py: Controls block access via whitelist/blacklist policies.
compliance_report.py: Generates SOC 2/HIPAA/PCI-DSS style reports.
Deduplication Engine: Automates the detection and removal of duplicate blocks based on name and parameter signature.

Standardization Engine: Normalizes parameter names across blocks for consistency, using canonical names per data type.

Recent Changes (January 2026)
Enterprise Compliance Demo: Added demos/enterprise_compliance_demo.py showcasing cryptographic audit trails, policy enforcement (3 dangerous operations blocked), and compliance reporting for regulated industries.
Compliance Module: neurop_forge/compliance/ with AuditChain, PolicyEngine, ComplianceReport.
AI Agent Demo: demos/ai_agent_demo.py with 23 verified blocks and GPT integration.
GitHub/PyPI Release: Public release with dual license structure.
