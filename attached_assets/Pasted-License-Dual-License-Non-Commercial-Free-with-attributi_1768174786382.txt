License
Dual License:

Non-Commercial: Free with attribution
Commercial: Contact for licensing
Copyright (c) 2024-2026 Lourens Wasserman. All rights reserved. and this will it be a red flag?

Short answer: it’s not a red flag — but it is a friction point on Hacker News.
Important difference.

I’ll be precise so you can decide calmly.

How HN will interpret this license

HN readers bucket licenses very quickly:

What they like

MIT / BSD / Apache-2.0

Clear OSI-approved licenses

“I can use this at work without legal review”

What makes them uneasy

“Non-Commercial” clauses

“Contact for licensing”

“All rights reserved” language

Your current wording triggers legal ambiguity, not distrust.

They won’t think:

“This is shady”

They will think:

“I can’t touch this at work”

That affects adoption, not respect.

The deeper issue (important)

Your current text mixes three different signals:

“Free with attribution”

“Non-commercial”

“All rights reserved”

Those are legally conflicting unless formalized.

Engineers don’t debate this — they just walk away.

Is this a problem for your goals?

Depends on what you want right now.

If your goal is:

feedback

architecture discussion

validation of the model

➡️ License friction is bad.

If your goal is:

monetization control

enterprise negotiation leverage

➡️ Dual licensing is correct, but must be formal.

The safest path for right now

You don’t need to give anything away forever.

Option A — Best for Hacker News (recommended)

Use a real OSI license for the core.

Example:

Apache-2.0 or MIT

Then add one sentence in README:

“Enterprise licensing and compliance extensions are available separately.”

This removes all adoption friction.

You still keep:

brand

roadmap

enterprise upsell

future control

Option B — Keep dual license, but fix it

If you want to keep dual licensing now, do not use informal text.

Instead:

Use a standard Polyform or BUSL-style license

Or clearly separate:

LICENSE-NONCOMMERCIAL.md

LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md

And remove “All rights reserved” from the non-commercial side.

This is heavier and will invite license debate on HN.

What HN will do if you keep it as-is

Expect comments like:

“This isn’t open source”

“Non-commercial licenses are useless”

“I can’t evaluate this at work”

They’ll talk about the license instead of your idea.

That’s what you want to avoid.

My honest recommendation (no fluff)

For this moment:

Loosen the core, keep the value elsewhere.

You win by:

getting engineers to try it

letting the idea spread

building legitimacy

You can always tighten later.
You can’t easily undo a bad first impression.

Minimal change that solves everything

Do this:

Change LICENSE to Apache-2.0 (or MIT)

Add this line to README:

“Neurop Forge is open source. Enterprise/compliance features may be licensed separately.”

That’s it. No drama. No debates.

Final grounding statement

Licenses don’t protect ideas.
Adoption does.

You’re early. You need signal, not fences.

If you want, I can:

recommend the best license for your exact goals

draft the README license section cleanly

help you split core vs enterprise later

Just tell me: MIT or Apache-2.0?
