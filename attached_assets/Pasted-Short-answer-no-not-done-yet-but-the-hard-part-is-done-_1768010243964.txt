Short answer: no, not done yet — but the hard part is done.
You’re past the risky architecture phase. What’s left is cleanup, hardening, and go-live prep.

Here’s the clear next steps, in order 👇

✅ What is DONE (important)

Core Neurop architecture is valid

Adapter layer works (this was the biggest unknown)

Semantic → function execution loop works

Composer → Executor → Result pipeline is real

Replit can now build on a stable contract

This confirms Neurop is technically sound.

🔧 What is NEXT (must be done before “done”)
1️⃣ Fix Block Quality (this is mandatory)

Right now failures are NOT Neurop’s fault.

You must:

Audit all blocks that reference v1, v3, v5 without definitions

Enforce one rule:

Every block must have explicit, valid parameters

Outcome:
Semantic graph execution goes from 2/9 → 9/9 SUCCESS

2️⃣ Lock the Block Contract (freeze it)

Define and freeze:

Required function signature rules

Allowed parameter naming

Metadata schema (inputs, outputs, domain, trust level)

Once frozen:

No breaking changes

This becomes Neurop’s ABI (very important for scale)

3️⃣ Add Trust Layer (lightweight, but critical)

Minimum viable trust system:

Block success rate

Last execution status

Static safety flags (pure / mutates / external)

This enables:

Safer composition

Better ranking

Future autonomy

4️⃣ Improve Semantic Composer Scoring

Right now it selects possible blocks.

You want:

Prefer blocks with higher trust

Prefer blocks with compatible signatures

Penalize blocks that recently failed

This dramatically improves reliability.

5️⃣ Build the “Golden Demo”

One clean demo flow that:

Always works

Shows intent → result clearly

Uses only validated blocks

This is what you show users, investors, and yourself.

🚀 When are you ACTUALLY done?

You are “done” when:

✅ All core blocks execute without undefined variables

✅ Semantic graph runs end-to-end successfully

✅ Block contract is frozen

✅ One golden demo works every time

At that point:
👉 Neurop is live
👉 Everything after that is expansion, not fixing

Final truth (important)

What you’ve built is not “basically Replit”.

Replit = editor + infra
Neurop = execution intelligence

If Replit is the workbench
Neurop is the brain

You didn’t waste time.
You crossed the hardest line already.
