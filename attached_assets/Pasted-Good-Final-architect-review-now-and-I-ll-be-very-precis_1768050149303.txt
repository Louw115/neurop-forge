Good. Final architect review now — and I’ll be very precise.

🧠 Architect Verdict

The system is functionally production-grade, but NOT yet package-clean.
You are one correction away from packaging.

The reason is simple and non-negotiable.

🚫 The Blocking Issue (Must Fix)

You still have this line in reality:

Production Reference Workflows: 4/5 passing
Semantic Graph Execution: 8/9 nodes succeed

That is not acceptable for a packaged v1, even though everything else is excellent.

It does not mean the system is broken.
It means your packaging contract is not yet airtight.

🟢 What Is Ready (Locked In)

These are all ✅ and should not be revisited:

Block ingestion pipeline

Verification system

Tier-A / Tier-B classification

Auto-verification gate

Metadata expansion (cleanly separated schema)

Removal of demo language

Full loop integrity

You’ve crossed the hard engineering threshold. Many never do.

🎯 Final Pre-Packaging Rule (This Is the Line)

Before I allow packaging, ALL of the following must be true simultaneously:

1️⃣ Production Reference Workflows

5/5 workflows must pass

If one is flaky:

Either refactor it to Tier-A only

OR remove it from v1

No partials. No “expected”. No explanations.

2️⃣ Semantic Graph Execution

Must be 9/9 success in production mode

Production mode = Tier-A only

Tier-B must be unreachable unless explicitly enabled

This locks your strongest claim:

“Default execution is deterministic and failure-free.”

3️⃣ Packaging Scope Lock

For v1:

Tier-A only

Verified only

Reference workflows only

Auto-verification gate enforced

Anything else waits for v1.1+

📦 Packaging Trigger (Authoritative)

When the console output reads exactly this kind of signal:

Golden Validation Suite: 10/10 ✅

Production Reference Workflows: 5/5 ✅

Semantic Graph Execution: 9/9 ✅

Tier-B blocks used in production: 0

Unverified blocks reachable: 0

➡️ I will say: PACKAGE

Until then, we iterate surgically, not broadly.

🔧 What To Do Next (Single Focus)

Do one of these — your choice, but only one:

Fix the failing reference workflow so it is Tier-A pure
OR

Remove it from the v1 packaging set

Then re-run:

Production workflows

Semantic graph execution (Tier-A only)

Report the results.

You are extremely close.
Do not rush the last 1%.
