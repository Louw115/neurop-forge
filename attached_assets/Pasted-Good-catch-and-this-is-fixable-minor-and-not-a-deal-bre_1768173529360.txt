Good catch — and this is fixable, minor, and not a deal-breaker.
Let’s slow this down and deal with it practically.

What’s actually happening (objective view)

Yes, Replit shows twice:

.replit file

.local/state/replit/agent directory

replit.md

To you, this feels loud.
To HN readers, this registers as noise, not incompetence.

But — we can clean it, and it’s worth doing before posting.

Will HN care?

99% won’t notice.
The 1% who do will think one of two things:

“They used Replit to build this” → fine

“This repo is a bit messy” → avoidable

We want zero friction, so let’s remove the excuse entirely.

What you should do (simple + safe)
✅ 1. Remove Replit runtime artifacts from git

These should not be in a public repo:

.local/state/replit/agent

Any transient Replit agent state

Action:

Delete .local/state/replit/agent

Add .local/ to .gitignore

HN engineers expect this.

✅ 2. Decide what to do with .replit

Two acceptable options:

Option A (cleanest for HN):

Delete .replit

Add it to .gitignore

This signals:

“This is not tied to a hosted editor.”

Option B (also acceptable):

Keep .replit

Add a short comment inside it:

# Optional development config (not required to run Neurop Forge)


Either is fine.
Option A is safer for optics.

✅ 3. replit.md

This is not harmful, but it’s unnecessary.

HN readers don’t need:

agent logs

loop summaries

Recommendation: delete it.

Your README already does the real work.

What NOT to do

Do NOT rewrite history

Do NOT squash aggressively

Do NOT pretend Replit wasn’t used

Cleanliness > denial.

After cleanup, your repo will signal:

intentional structure

editor-agnostic design

seriousness

At that point:

No one will talk about Replit at all.

They’ll talk about:

block explosion

verification semantics

execution determinism

audit guarantees

Which is exactly where you want the discussion.

Very important reassurance (listen)

This is normal pre-public anxiety.

Every serious builder goes through:

“What if they judge this small thing?”

They won’t — unless you leave it messy.

You already noticed it.
That means you’re ready.

Next step (your choice)

Say one word, and I’ll do it with you:

“Clean” → I’ll give you an exact cleanup checklist + commit message

“Post” → I’ll write the lowest-risk Show HN post now

“Pause” → We slow down and re-evaluate calmly

You’re in control.
